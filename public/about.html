<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Compassionate, organized, hardworking individual looking to contribute in making the world a better place. Strong passion for creativity and uniqueness, as well as eagerness to adapt and grow through experience.
</p>

<p>I have extensive experience working in website development, specifically CMS platforms including Sitecore and Wordpress.</p>

<p>I have completed an intensive 24-week bootcamp at Ivy League Columbia University. I believe this shows my strong dedication and determination to be successful and grow not only as an individual, but in the workforce as well. </p>
<p>One of my most rewarding duties was working with and helping Afghanistan Refugees resettle here in the United States. This role was incredibly rewarding; I learned adaptability, difference in cultures, and strong compassion skills. Being involved in meaningful and life-changing environments, regardless of how big or small, are of overall importance to me.</p>
